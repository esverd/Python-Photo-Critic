A Greater Roadrunner stands alert on a rocky outcrop in Big Bend National Park, Texas. The rugged mountains provide a stunning backdrop to this iconic desert bird. Known for their speed and agility, roadrunners are a common sight in the park, often seen darting across roads and trails.Their long legs and tail give them a distinctive silhouette, and their bright eyes and sharp beak are perfect for hunting insects, lizards, and small rodents.

This image was captured during a morning hike in the Chisos Mountains. The early morning light cast a warm glow on the landscape, highlighting the textures and colors of the rocks and the bird's plumage.

The roadrunner's alertness and the dramatic setting make this a memorable image.

A Greater Roadrunner stands alert on a rocky outcrop in Big Bend National Park, Texas. The rugged mountains provide a stunning backdrop to this iconic desert bird. Known for their speed and agility, roadrunners are a common sight in the park, often seen darting across roads and trails.This image was taken during a recent visit to Big Bend, where I spent several days exploring the park's diverse landscapes and wildlife. The roadrunner was a highlight of my trip, and I was lucky enough to capture this moment.

I hope you enjoy this image!
